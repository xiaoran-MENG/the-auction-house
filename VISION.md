# The Auction House

## Vision Statement
The best place to auction and bid on any university-related items for students.

The Auction House is primarily designed for university students. The system allows users to auction and bid on textbooks as well as other student commodities. With our auctioning system, users can always offer what they feel is an appropriate price for textbooks or other student goods.

The ability to easily buy and sell second-hand goods is an important part of the student community. Considering students are often on a tight budget, this allows them to buy textbooks and other commodities for a cheaper price. Since students move between cities, for co-op or graduation, it also allows them to sell off items they cannot travel with. Having a localized market for these transactions within the university allows students to easily participate. There will be little commute required for students who are living on campus and the market would be specific to the items students are interested in.

Furthermore, local auctioning is a service that has yet to be provided. Currently, students use Facebook Marketplace for their buying or selling. Although this does allow for general transactions to take place, it does not offer users to host online auctions, and is not optimised for studentsâ€™ use case. Our system will fulfill this role in the university market.

Since our users are students, the system will require that our users sign up using student emails. This means all of the users will be identified and are guaranteed to be your fellow students. With identification, the system can provide a more secure and safe environment for third party exchange of goods.

As additional security measures, users are kept protected by our reporting and trust factor systems. These systems guarantee that troublemakers can be banned, and users can be informed about the trustworthiness of others before meeting them to exchange goods. In addition to these security measures, the system will encourage users to meet in public areas such as the university centre and other on-campus areas.

This system is a greatly improved environment compared to other currently used third party marketplaces as we offer more tailored features for university students. As a result, students who need to auction away textbooks have a focused and efficient interface as well as the benefit of not competing in a marketplace filled with a variety of goods.

The success of the system would be tracked based on an increase of atleast 10% more transactions per semester. An increase in the average number of transactions per semester would give a measurable value of how many more students are willing to use our system and our possible growth. In addition to this, if the app is published through a 3rd party platform such as the Play Store, success will be measured having a rating of 4 stars. Also, through our trust factor system, we can measure the security and safety of our marketplace. Having 90% of our users have a trust score of 4 out of 5 stars is part of our success criteria.
